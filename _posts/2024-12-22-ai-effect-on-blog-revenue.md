title: "AI’s Effect on Blog Revenue—My Data"
comments: true
---

When I started this blog in 2012 one of my motivations was to make a bit of money. In those days if you had a successful blog that generated traffic, you could work out an ad deal and bring in some recurring cash for your effort.

And it worked—at least a little. By 2016 or so my blog was generating $40–$50 a month, which wasn’t life altering, but it was a nice bit of recurring revenue I got for keeping this site up and running.

In the last few years I’ve focused on [publishing elsewhere](/writing), but I’ve kept this blog up, kept it fast, and ensured all links continued to work. From a revenue perspective my earnings started slowly dropping after I stopped regularly publishing—which I expected and makes sense.

What’s more interesting is what’s happened in the last two years.

The chart above shows my earnings per month since March 2018 (which is as far back as I have data). What starts as a slow-and-steady earnings decline, quickly accelerates around the end of 2022. And while I have no hard evidence as for why this decline starts, I have one strong theory.

I don’t post this data for you to feel sorry for me. This blog has always been a side project for me, and my primary goal with it has always been to write for writing’s sake (like I’m doing now!).

I’m posting this because I think it’s interesting to see hard data on the effect AI has had on a random tech blog. I do most of my development searches with ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot nowadays, and it seems like most of the rest of you do too.

And while I’m excited about the AI future, this experience also has me feeling a bit nostalgic for the glory days of the tech blog.

Here’s my full data in case you’re curious.
